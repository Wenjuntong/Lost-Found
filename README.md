# Lost-Found

This is a lost & found web system where users could register their accounts and use them to log in to the lost and found system to post notices of lost and found items. Users can interact with each other, reply to all pending notices and see the details of all notices. In addition to the user side, we have also created an administrator account to view the details of users and notices.
